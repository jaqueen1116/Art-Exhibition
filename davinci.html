                <ul>
                    <li>Created: 1503-1506</li>
                    <li>Medium: Oil on poplar panel</li>
                    <li><p>Description: Mona Lisa is perhaps the most famous painting in the world, 
                        renowned for the subject's enigmatic smile and the use of sfumato, a technique 
                        of blending colors and tones. Painted during the Renaissance, this portrait of Lisa 
                        Gherardini, the wife of a wealthy Florentine merchant, captures a moment of subtle 
                        emotional expression, blending realism with idealism. The mysterious quality of her 
                        smile has fascinated viewers for centuries.</p></li>

                    <li>Medium: Oil on canvas</li>
                    <li><p>Description: Lady with an Ermine is a portrait of Cecilia Gallerani, the mistress of 
                        Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. Da Vinci's exquisite attention to detail is evident in 
                        the soft rendering of her face and the delicate fur of the ermine. The relaxed yet 
                        dignified pose of the subject, along with her graceful expression, captures a moment of 
                        intimate yet sophisticated portrayal, demonstrating Da Vinci's skill in human psychology 
                        and naturalism.</p></li>
