                <ul>
                    <li>Created: 1903-1904</li>
                    <li>Medium: Oil on canvas</li>
                    <li><p>Description: The Old Guitarist was painted during Picasso's Blue Period, a time
                        marked by deep emotional and financial struggles. The painting shows an elderly man,
                        gaunt and frail, playing a guitar. The somber blue tones and elongated form of the
                        figure symbolize the themes of poverty, loneliness, and despair, reflecting Picasso's
                        personal hardships at the time.</p></li>

                    <li>Medium: Oil on canvas</li>
                    <li><p>Description: This iconic portrait features Picasso's muse, Marie-Thérèse Walter, 
                        gazing into a mirror. The painting explores the duality of her identity, with bold and 
                        distorted shapes symbolizing both the reflection and her inner emotions. The use of bright,
                        contrasting colors highlights the tension between the external and internal, portraying themes
                        of self-awareness, beauty, and vanity.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Description: Picasso's Self Portrait from 1901 was created during his Blue Period,
                        showcasing his introspective nature and emotional turmoil. The painting features a solemn,
                        introspective expression and is characterized by the use of deep blue and gray tones.
                        Picasso's vulnerable portrayal of himself reflects his struggles during this period,
                        as he dealt with the loss of a close friend and the poverty he faced.</p></li>

                    <li>Medium: Oil on canvas</li>
                    <li><p>Description: This painting marks the transition between Picasso's Blue and Rose Periods.
                        Les Noces de Pierrette (The Wedding of Pierrette) depicts a wedding scene with a melancholic 
                        tone, using a palette of light pinks and earthy colors. The elongated figures and stylized 
                        faces convey a sense of emotional detachment, as Picasso begins to explore themes of love,
                        relationships, and social roles in a more somber way.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Description: Family of Saltimbanques is a key work from Picasso's Rose Period,
                        showcasing a group of circus performers in a melancholic and isolated setting. 
                        The painting reflects the emotional sensitivity of the artist at the time, using soft pink
                        tones and muted colors to depict the sadness and struggle of the performers, 
                        embodying themes of alienation and human fragility.</p></li>

                    <li>Medium: Oil on canvas</li>
                    <li><p>Description: Guernica is Picasso's most famous anti-war painting, created in 
                        response to the bombing of the Basque town of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War.
                        The large-scale work uses a monochromatic palette to convey the horror and chaos of war.
                        Picasso's distorted and anguished figures evoke the pain, suffering, and devastation 
                        caused by violence, making it a powerful symbol of the horrors of conflict.</p></li>

                    <li>Medium: Oil on canvas</li>
                    <li><p>Description: Seated Woman depicts Picasso's muse, Marie-Thérèse Walter, sitting in 
                        a relaxed pose. The work is notable for its Cubist influence, with fragmented and 
                        abstracted forms that emphasize her geometric shapes. The use of bold, warm colors 
                        contrasts with the more muted tones of previous works, reflecting Picasso's shift 
                        towards a more playful and experimental approach during this period.</p></li>
