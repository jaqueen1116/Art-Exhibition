        <h2>Theme of the Exhibition</h2>
        <p>The theme of <strong>Art Exhibition 2025</strong> is <em>“The Evolution of Artistic Genius”</em>.
             This exhibition explores how three iconic artists—<strong>Vincent Van Gogh</strong>, 
             <strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong>, and <strong>Pablo Picasso</strong>—have shaped and transformed 
             the art world over centuries.</p>

        <p>Each artist in this exhibition challenged conventional artistic boundaries in their time,
             creating works that revolutionized the way we understand art. From the realism of Da Vinci,
              to the emotional depth of Van Gogh, and the radical innovation of Picasso's Cubism, 
              this exhibition highlights the uniqueness and lasting influence of these legendary figures 
              in the world of visual arts.</p>

        <p>Join us as we delve into the creative worlds of these masters, exploring their iconic works and the 
            underlying themes of passion, innovation, and self-expression that have defined their legacies.</p>
