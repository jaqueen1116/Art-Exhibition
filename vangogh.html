                        showcasing vibrant blues and yellows. The painting was created during 
                        his time in a mental asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. It represents a sense of longing,
                        with the night sky conveying both beauty and turbulence.</p></li>

                        Van Gogh created while living in Arles. Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers is known for
                        its bold use of yellow tones, symbolizing warmth and life. The flowers are arranged 
                        in a way that evokes both beauty and fragility, demonstrating Van Gogh's fascination

                    <li><p>Description: The Night Café depicts a dimly lit, chaotic café scene,
                        using strong reds and greens. Van Gogh wanted to evoke a sense of unease and 
                        discomfort in this painting, choosing these colors to create an intense, 
                        unsettling atmosphere. It is believed to symbolize the darker side of human nature, 
                        as Van Gogh sought to capture the feeling of isolation and despair.</p></li>

                        with stars reflecting on the water. Van Gogh contrasts the tranquil nature of
                        the river with the brilliance of the stars in the sky. The painting also features
                        the reflections of gaslight from the nearby town, illustrating Van Gogh's ability to

                        The distorted perspective of the room suggests the artist's emotional unrest,
